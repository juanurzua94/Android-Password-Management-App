# Android-Password-Management-App

This is an android app i created for storing passwords. To access the app the user needs to use fingerprint authentication. Once the user successfully authenticates and accesses the app,
a list of websites will be displayed in which the user can click on one to see the username and password they have for that specified website. The app contains a page where the user
can enter the name of a website, the username for that website, and its password. The data is encrypted and saved into a local SQLite file. There is also a history usage page
for the app so that the user can know if there is ever any suspicious access to the app that they were unaware of.
